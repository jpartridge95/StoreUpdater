# StoreUpdater

### What It does.

This store updater app is designed to take data from a txt file and through various business rules advance both the time remaining to sell the item and the quality value of the item.

### How to use it

#### Step one
After cloning the repo, Create a .txt file in the Reports folder of the InventoryUpdater project folder.

**Notes**
The filename of the .txt file must be the current date in the following format DD-MM-YYYY for example the 21st of March 2015 would be 21-03-2015.txt
The list of items should be structured as so:
[**ProductName**] [**SellIn**] [**Quality**]
